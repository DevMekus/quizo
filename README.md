## **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/quiz-application.git
cd quiz-application
```

### 2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. **Set Up the Database**

```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```

### 5. **Set Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the following environment variables:

```plaintext
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///quiz.db  # Use your preferred database URL
```

### 6. **Run the Application**

```bash
flask run
```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## **Running the Application**

After setup, you can start the application by running:

```bash
python app.py
```

To access the admin interface or use the API, you can send HTTP requests from your frontend or tools like Postman. For example, to log in as an admin or user:

```bash
POST http://localhost:5000/auth/login
```

## **Frontend Structure**

You can integrate the API with a JavaScript frontend using `fetch` or Axios to send HTTP requests. Hereâ€™s an example of sending a request to log in:

```javascript
fetch("http://localhost:5000/auth/login", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    username: "user1",
    password: "password123",
  }),
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
    // Store the token or handle the response
  });
```
